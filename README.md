### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in the MolMD group at Stony Brook University looking into how data can be used to expedite materials design and discovery. For this, I'm also developing new computational tools for predicting and optimizing materials properties. 

Feel free to reach out to me about any project @ rasha.atwi@stonybrook.edu
