### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Research Scientist in the Medicinal Chemistry department at Biogen. My expertise is in computational chemistry and cheminformatics, focusing on quantum-chemical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, high-throughput computational screening, and machine learning. While I am currently working on drug discovery, my previous and current research interests also include the design of new materials for energy storage and conversion applications.
