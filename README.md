### Hi there 👋🏻

I'm a Research Scientist in the Medicinal Chemistry department at Biogen. My expertise is in computational chemistry and cheminformatics, focusing on quantum-chemical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, high-throughput computational screening, and machine learning. While I'm currently working on drug discovery, my previous and current research interests also include the design of new materials for energy storage and conversion applications.
